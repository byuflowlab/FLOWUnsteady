FLOWUnsteady is an open-source variable-fidelity framework for unsteady
aerodynamics and aeroacoustics based on the
[reformulated vortex particle method](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/9589/)
(rVPM).
This suite brings together various tools developed by the
[FLOW Lab](http://flow.byu.edu/) at Brigham Young University: Vortex lattice
method, strip theory, blade elements, 3D panel method, and rVPM.
The suite also integrates an FW-H solver and a BPM code for tonal
and broadband prediction of aeroacoustic noise.
In the low end of fidelity, simulations are similar to a free-wake method,
while in the high end simulations become meshless large eddy simulations.

### What is the Reformulated VPM?

The [reformulated VPM](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/9589/) is a meshless
CFD method solving the LES-filtered incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in
their vorticity form,
<p align="center">
    <img src="http://edoalvar2.groups.et.byu.net/public/FLOWUnsteady/vorticityns.png" alt="img" style="width:40%">
</p>
It uses a Lagrangian (meshless) scheme, which not only
avoids the hurdles of mesh generation, but it also conserves vortical structures
over long distances with minimal numerical dissipation.

The rVPM uses particles to discretize the Navier-Stokes equations, with the
particles representing radial basis functions that construct a continuous
vorticity/velocity field. The basis functions become the LES filter, providing a
variable filter width and spatial adaptation as the particles are convected and
stretched by the velocity field. The local evolution of the filter width
provides an extra degree of freedom to reinforce conservation laws, which makes
the reformulated VPM numerically stable (overcoming the numerical issues that
plague the classic VPM).

This meshless LES has several advantages over conventional mesh-based CFD.
In the absence of a mesh,   
1. the rVPM does not suffer from the numerical dissipation introduced by a mesh
2. integrates over coarser discretizations without losing physical accuracy
3. derivatives are calculated analytically rather than approximated through a stencil.

Furthermore, rVPM is highly efficient since it uses computational elements only
where there is vorticity (rather than meshing the entire space), usually being ~100x
faster than conventional mesh-based LES with comparable accuracy.


While rVPM is well suited for resolving unbounded flows (wakes), complications
arise when attempting to impose boundary conditions (solid boundaries) on the flow.
This is because (1) the method is meshless, and (2) boundary conditions must
be imposed on the Navier-Stokes equations in the form of vorticity.
FLOWUnsteady is a framework designed to introduce solid boundaries into the rVPM
using actuator models.
Wings and rotors are introduced in the computational domain through actuator
line and surface models that use low-fidelity aerodynamic methods
(*e.g.*, VLM, lifting line,
panels, etc) to compute forces and embed the associated
vorticity back into the LES domain.

### Variable Fidelity

rVPM considerably reduces engineering time by avoiding the hurdles of mesh
generation. Furthermore, since it is not limited by the time-step and stability
constraints of conventional mesh-based CFD, rVPM can be used across all levels
of fidelity, all in the same framework by simply coarsening or refining the
simulation.
In the low end of fidelity, simulations are similar to a free-wake method,
while in the high end simulations become meshless large eddy simulations.
Thus, FLOWUnsteady can be used as a high-fidelity tool that is orders of
magnitude faster than mesh-based CFD, or as a variable-fidelity tool for
the different stages of design.
