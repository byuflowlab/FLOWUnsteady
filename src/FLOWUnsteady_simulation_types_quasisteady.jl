    # TIME-STEPPING PROCEDURE:
    # -1) Solve one particle field time step
    # 0) Translate and rotate systems
    # 1) Recalculate horseshoes with kinematic velocity
    # 2) Paste previous Gamma solution to new system position after translation
    # 3) Shed semi-infinite wake after translation
    # 4) Calculate wake-induced velocity on VLM and Rotor system
    # 5) Solve VLM and Rotor system
    # 6) Shed unsteady-loading wake after new solution
    # 7) Save new solution as prev solution
    # Iterate
    #
    # On the first time step (pfield.nt==0), it only does steps (5) and (7),
    # meaning that the unsteady wake of the first time step is never shed.
