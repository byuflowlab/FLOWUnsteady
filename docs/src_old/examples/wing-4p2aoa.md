In this example we simulate a $45^\circ$ swept-back wing at
an angle of attack of $4.2^\circ$.
In the process we exemplify the basic structure of simulations, which is
always the same, no matter how complex the simulation might be.
The structure consists of six steps:

>**[(1) Vehicle Definition](@ref vehicle_types):** Generate the geometry of the vehicle and declare each vehicle subsystem in a [`FLOWUnsteady.VLMVehicle`](@ref) object

> **[(2) Maneuver Definition](@ref):** Generate functions that prescribe the kinematics of the vehicle and specify the control inputs for tilting and rotor subsystems in a [`FLOWUnsteady.KinematicManeuver`](@ref) object

> **[(3) Simulation Definition](@ref):** A [`FLOWUnsteady.Simulation`](@ref) object is generated stating the vehicle, maneuver, and total time and speed at which to perform the maneuver

>**[(4) Monitors Definitions](@ref):** Functions are generated for calculating, monitoring, and outputting different metrics throughout the simulation

> **[(5) Run Simulation](@ref):** Call to [`FLOWUnsteady.run_simulation`](@ref)

> **[(6) Viz and Postprocessing](@ref fluid_domain):** The simulation is visualized in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) and results are postprocessed

While in this example we show the basic structure without much explanation,
in subsequent examples we will dive into the details and options of each
step (which are also listed in the [API Guide](@ref vehicle_types)).

# DESCRIPTION
    45° swept-back wing at an angle of attack of 4.2°. This wing has an aspect
    ratio of 5.0, a RAE 101 airfoil section with 12% thickness, and no dihedral,
    twist, nor taper. This test case matches the experimental setup of Weber,
    J., and Brebner, G., “Low-Speed Tests on 45-deg Swept-Back Wings, Part I,”
    Tech. rep., 1951. The same case is used in a VLM calculation in Bertin's
    Aerodynamics for Engineers, Example 7.2, pp. 343.

# ----------------- 1) VEHICLE DEFINITION --------------------------------------
println("Generating geometry...")

# Generate wing
wing = vlm.simpleWing(b, ar, tr, twist_root, lambda, gamma;
                        twist_tip=twist_tip, n=n, r=r, central=central);

# NOTE: `FLOWVLM.simpleWing` is an auxiliary function in FLOWVLM for creating a
#       VLM wing with constant sweep, dihedral, and taper ratio, and a linear
#       twist between the root and the wing tips

println("Generating vehicle...")

# Generate vehicle
system = vlm.WingSystem()                   # System of all FLOWVLM objects
vlm.addwing(system, "Wing", wing)

vlm_system = system;                        # System solved through VLM solver
wake_system = system;                       # System that will shed a VPM wake

vehicle = uns.VLMVehicle(   system;
                            vlm_system=vlm_system,
                            wake_system=wake_system
                         );

# NOTE: `FLOWUnsteady.VLMVehicle` creates a vehicle made out of multiple VLM and
#       rotor subsystems. The argument `system` represents the vehicle as a
#       whole which will be translated and rotated with the kinematics
#       prescribed by the maneuver. The subsystem `vlm_system` will be solved
#       with the VLM solver. The subsystems `rotor_systems` are solved with
#       blade elements (none in this case). The subsystem `wake_system` will
#       shed the VPM wake.




# ------------- 2) MANEUVER DEFINITION -----------------------------------------

Vvehicle(t) = zeros(3)                      # Translational velocity of vehicle over time
anglevehicle(t) = zeros(3)                  # Angle of the vehicle over time

angle = ()                                  # Angle of each tilting system (none)
RPM = ()                                    # RPM of each rotor system (none)

maneuver = uns.KinematicManeuver(angle, RPM, Vvehicle, anglevehicle)

# NOTE: `FLOWUnsteady.KinematicManeuver` defines a maneuver with prescribed
#       kinematics. `Vvehicle` defines the velocity of the vehicle (a vector)
#       over time. `anglevehicle` defines the attitude of the vehicle over time
#       (a vector with inclination angles with respect to each axis of the
#       global coordinate system). `angle` defines the tilting angle of each
#       tilting system over time (none in this case). `RPM` defines the RPM of
#       each rotor system over time (none in this case).
#       Each of these functions receives a nondimensional time `t`, which is the
#       simulation time normalized by the total time `ttot`, from 0 to
#       1, beginning to end of simulation. They all return a nondimensional
#       output that is then scaled up by either a reference velocity (`Vref`) or
#       a reference RPM (`RPMref`). Defining the kinematics and controls of the
#       maneuver in this way allows the user to have more control over how fast
#       to perform the maneuver, since the total time, reference velocity and
#       RPM are then defined in the simulation parameters shown below.




# ------------- 3) SIMULATION DEFINITION ---------------------------------------

Vref = 0.0                                  # Reference velocity to scale maneuver by
RPMref = 0.0                                # Reference RPM to scale maneuver by
Vinit = Vref*Vvehicle(0)                    # Initial vehicle velocity
Winit = pi/180*(anglevehicle(1e-6) - anglevehicle(0))/(1e-6*ttot)  # Initial angular velocity

                                            # Maximum number of particles
max_particles = (nsteps+1)*(vlm.get_m(vehicle.vlm_system)*(p_per_step+1) + p_per_step)

simulation = uns.Simulation(vehicle, maneuver, Vref, RPMref, ttot;
                                                    Vinit=Vinit, Winit=Winit);




# ------------- 4) MONITORS DEFINITIONS ----------------------------------------

# NOTE: Monitors are functions that are called at every time step to perform
#       some secondary computation after the solution of that time step has been
#       obtained. In this case, the wing monitor uses the circulation and
#       induced velocities to compute aerodynamic forces and decompose them
#       into lift and drag. The monitor then plots these forces at every time
#       step while also saving them under a CSV file in the simulation folder.

# Generate function that calculates aerodynamic forces
# NOTE: We exclude skin friction since we want to compare to the experimental
#       data reported in Weber 1951 that was measured with pressure taps
