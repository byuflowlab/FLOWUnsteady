# [Installation Instructions](@id installation)

FLOWUnsteady is developed in [Julia](https://julialang.org), a modern, high-level, dynamics programming language for high-performance computing. For visualization and postprocessing, FLOWUnsteady uses [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org), which is an open-source software for scientific and HPC visualization.

The following instructions walk you through how to install Julia, ParaView, and FLOWUnsteady.


!!! info "Windows Users"
    On Windows please follow [these instructions](@ref windows) first to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Julia

* Download and install Julia: [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads)
* Add Julia to user-level `bin` folder
  ```bash
  sudo ln -s /[user-specific-path/Julia-1.x.x]/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
  ```
  Replace `/[user-specific-path/Julia-1.x.x]/` with the path where Julia got
  installed.
  For instance, in MacOS the full path looks like this:
  `/Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia`

If you were successfull, typing the following in the terminal will launch the
Julia REPL:
```bash
julia
```


## [ParaView](@id paraview)

* Download and install ParaView: [paraview.org](https://www.paraview.org/download/)
* Add ParaView to user-level `bin` folder
  ```bash
  sudo ln -s /[user-specific-path/ParaView-5.x.x]/paraview /usr/local/bin/paraview
  ```
  Replace `/[user-specific-path/ParaView-5.x.x]/` with the path where ParaView got
  installed.
  For instance, in MacOS the full path looks like this:
  `/Applications/ParaView-5.11.0.app/Contents/MacOS/paraview`

If you were successfull, typing the following in the terminal will launch the
ParaView:
```bash
paraview
```

## Unregistered Julia Packages
FLOWUnsteady depends on the following unregistered Julia packages:
1. [FastMultipole](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FastMultipole) : `github.com/byuflowlab/FastMultipole`
2. [FLOWVPM](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWVPM.jl) : `github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWVPM.jl`
3. [BPM](https://github.com/byuflowlab/BPM.jl) : `github.com/byuflowlab/BPM.jl`
4. [FLOWNoise](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWNoise) : `github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWNoise`

Each of these may be installed using the Julia command in the REPL
```julia
] add packageLink
```
where `packageLink` is the github link to each package.

Optionally, you may also want to test these packages for installation issues using the Julia command in the REPL
```julia
] test packageName
```

!!! info "Troubleshooting"
    Some things you might need to look out for:
    * *(MacOS users)* Make sure your Homebrew (in Julia) is up to date. You may need to run the following in order to update your Homebrew: ```using Homebrew; Homebrew.brew(`update-reset`)```
    * Make sure that things are in place in your Julia settings. Having things like Conda, HDF5, etc. on your machine doesn't necessarily mean that the Julia implementation has them as well.


## Add FLOWUnsteady

You are now ready to install the FLOWUnsteady package. Type this in the Julia REPL:

```
] add https://github.com/byuflowlab/FLOWUnsteady
```

## Plots

FLOWUnsteady was designed to be lightweight to avoid dependency issues and ensure easy installation. However, for visualizing results generated by FLOWUnsteady, it is recommended to have the [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) package installed. You can install it using the following command:

```julia
] add Plots
```
